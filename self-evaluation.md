# Self Evaluation

So for, I feel confident with arrays. I spent a lot of time working with them and doing some of my own experimentation as I found array methods interesting to work with.

I feel I was very thorough on this CFU and maybe spent too much time on it.

I don't have any questions about arrays at the moment.
